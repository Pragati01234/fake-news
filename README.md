# fake-news
What is fake news? Fake news is the deliberate
spread of misinformation via traditional news media or
via social media. False information spreads
extraordinarily fast. This is demonstrated by the fact that,
when one fake news site is taken down, another will
promptly take its place. In addition, fake news can
become indistinguishable from accurate reporting since
it spreads so fast. People can download articles from
sites, share the information, re-share from others and by
the end of the day the false information has gone so far
from its original site that it becomes indistinguishable
from real news
